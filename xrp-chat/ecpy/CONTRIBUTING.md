## Set up your dev environment

If you want to contribute code to `ECPy`, the following sections describe how to set up your developer environment.

### Manage dependencies and virtual environments

To simplify managing library dependencies and the virtual environment, `ECPy` uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs).

[Install `poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
poetry install
```
